About Me

I’m Tom, a cybersecurity threat analyst and aspiring AI engineer. I build tools that make complex things simple — from summarizing dense arXiv papers to helping vulnerable people navigate legal systems. I’m especially interested in GenAI, adversarial ML, and turning technical ideas into useful products.

Most of my work is open source, experimental, or a bit unusual — sometimes all three.
