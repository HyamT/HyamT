👋 Hey, I'm Tom

Cybersecurity Threat Analyst | Aspiring AI Engineer | Builder of Useful (and Weird) Things

I’m currently a Threat Analyst at KnowBe4, where I work at the intersection of data, phishing, and AI. Outside of work, I’m obsessed with building tools that solve real-world problems — whether that’s helping vulnerable people navigate complex systems, summarizing cybersecurity research for execs, or experimenting with adversarial AI just for the fun of it.

🧠 Interests

- AI/ML (especially GenAI, NLP, and reinforcement learning)

- Offensive security and adversarial ML

- Ethical hacking and CTFs

- Making business-friendly tools from deeply technical stuff

- Building projects end-to-end: from messy idea → structured prototype → GitHub repo

⚒️ Tech I Work With

Python, React Native, Firebase, MongoDB, SQL, C++, GitHub Actions, Hugging Face, Ollama, Whisper, and anything else I can wrestle into doing what I want.
🔨 Projects I’m Proud Of

- Legal Tech App (WIP) – A mobile app designed to help solicitors communicate clearly with vulnerable clients through simplified messages, events, and documents.

- arXivPaperPuller – Pulls the latest cybersecurity papers from arXiv and rewrites them into LinkedIn-style summaries using local LLMs.

- AI Simplifier – A WIP wrapper that listens for complex language and explains it on the spot (like Clippy, but for understanding legal and technical jargon).

- Security Scripts & Tools – Port scanners, password crackers, phishing detection scripts — all experiments, but grounded in practical use.

🧪 Currently Learning

- Golang and distributed backend systems

- iOS app deployment

- Advanced model fine-tuning and AI/LLM safety
